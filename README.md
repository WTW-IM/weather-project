## Your Task

This project in its current state is a slightly modified version of the output from `dotnet new react` using ASP.NET Core 3.0.  Right now, static weather data is displayed in a table.

- Modify the project to allow the user to search for a location.
- Display a five day forecast for that location.  
- Use the [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/apis) which is free (up to 50 API calls per day) and well documented.  

## What we're looking for

- Working features
- Unit tests
- Clean, readable code
- Good design principles
- Commit history that is easy to follow

## Bonus points

- React function components and hooks
- Input validation
- Integration tests
- Resilient API calls
- Security
- Great user experience

When you are done, push your code to a public git repo, either on github or elsewhere, and send it our way.  Good luck!
